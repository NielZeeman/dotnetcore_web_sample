# Sample application highlighting docker information
This sample goes hand in hand with the blog posts as set out [here](http://www.teamfoundation.co.za/2017/01/docker-getting-started/), [here](http://www.teamfoundation.co.za/2017/01/create-and-run-a-dotnet-core-sample/) and [here](http://www.teamfoundation.co.za/2017/01/creating-your-first-container/)

This is the default dotnet core web application that is generated via `dotnet new -t web` command, but contains additional information about the environment that the application is being run in.
